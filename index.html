            <h2>The start for me.</h2>
            <article> <p>I started listening to <em>Tenacious D</em> when I was a kid.
                My father liked the band and played a few of their songs when I was a kid.
                <br>I still think back to the days that me and my family would sit around the tv and would watch the music video.
                <br>Even after all these years I can sing most of the song and tell you what was happening in the music video.
            </p>
            </article>
            <p>They are not only the first band I remember hearing but tribute was one
                of if not the very <strong>first song I heard ever. </strong>
                <br>Even years later I still like listening to their music including that very same song.</p>
