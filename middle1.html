            <p>It's a bit of rock and metal music. I enjoy metal and rock music it's the music I mostly listen to. <br>
            <em>Tenacious D</em> is the band that made me start listening to other metal bands.</p>
            <p>The members of the band is yet another reason I like this band.
                Two people are part of this band KJ and Jack Black himself. <br>
                They have been making music with each other for years now, but sadly they have broken up now.</p>
            <u>Since I've been listening to them for so long they have a hold on my heart and I will love them for that.</u>
